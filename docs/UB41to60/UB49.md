# UB49

Author: PeiHong Dai

## Definition

- **An expression having signed promoted type is left-shifted and either the value of the expression is negative or the result of shifting would not be representable in the promoted type (6.5.7).**
- *左移具有带符号提升类型的表达式时，表达式的值是负数或移位结果不能用提升类型表示*


## Description

- **If $E1$ has a signed type and nonnegative value, and $E1 \times 2^{E2}$ is representable in the result type, then that is the resulting value; otherwise, the behavior is undefined**. (P85)

## Code

- `UB49.c`

```c

```

## Configurations

- gcc 7.4.0

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

gcc -v : gcc version 7.4.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: gcc -o UB49.exe UB49.c && ./UB49.exe
```

- clang 6.0.0

```
OS: Microsoft Windows 11 22H2

clang -v : clang version 6.0.0, x86_64-w64-mingw32

compile and run commands: clang -o UB49.exe UB49.c && ./UB49.exe
```

## Behaviors

- gcc 7.4.0

```

```

- clang 6.0.0

```

```

## Advice

- When shifting types with promotions, double check for boundary violations.

- Table of common Promotions in C

- |   Original   |   Type Usually Promoted To   |
  | ---- | ---- |
  |   char   |   int   |
  |   bit-field   |   int   |
  |   enum   |   int   |
  |   unsigned char   |   int   |
  |   short   |   int   |
  |   unsigned short   |   int   |
  |   float   |   double   |
  |   array of anything   |   pointer to anything   |
